Twiddler files
==============================

This repo contains configuration files for one handed chording keyboard Twiddler.
As of 5/8/2015 I use both Twiddler versions 2.1 and 3.

I developed Backspice layout as an improvement of an already great TabSpace layout.
I use this layout all day, every day, at least for 8 hours. 
Usually doing software development using a Mac.

Backspice is an abbreviation of the 3 top buttons on the Twiddler: Backspace I Space.
"I" is in the middle of the layout to allows seeing mistyped chords and helps with correcting typos.
It's helps with typing without looking, i.e. while walking.

Note: Tabspice layout on this site is definitely optimized for using Twiddler with the left hand.
You probably want to create a mirror layout if you want to use Twiddler with your right hand.
Feel free to submit a pull request if you create such a layout.
