Twiddler files
==============================

This repo contains configuration files for the one handed chording keyboard Twiddler.
As of 8/17/2015 I use only Twiddler 3. 
I donâ€™t use Twiddler 2.1 anymore so my fingers don't have to keep adjusting from Twiddler 2 to Twiddler 3 buttons.

I developed Backspice layout as an improvement of an already great TabSpace layout.

I use this layout all day, every day, at least 8 hours per day. 
Usually doing software development on a Mac.

Backspice started as an abbreviation of the 3 top buttons on the Twiddler: Backspace I Space.
"I" is in the middle of the layout to allows seeing mistyped chords and helps with correcting typos.
It's helps with typing without looking, i.e. while walking.

My Backspice layout is optimized for using Twiddler with the left hand.
You would definitely need to create a mirror layout if you want to use Twiddler with your right hand.
Feel free to submit a pull request if you create such a layout.
