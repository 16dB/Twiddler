Twiddler files
==============================

This repo contains configuration files for the one handed chording keyboard Twiddler.

As of 8/17/2015 I use only Twiddler 3. 
I donâ€™t use Twiddler 2.1 anymore so my fingers don't have to keep adjusting from Twiddler 2 to Twiddler 3 buttons.

More info about this project can be found at http://google.com/+AlexBravo

I developed Backspice layout as an improvement of an already great TabSpace layout.

I use this layout all day, every day, at least 8 hours per day. 
Usually doing software development on a Mac.

Right now I only maintain Backspice layout for the left hand here, as I use only the left hand with it. 
You will definitely need to create a mirror layout if you want to use Twiddler with your right hand.
Feel free to submit a pull request if you create such a layout.
